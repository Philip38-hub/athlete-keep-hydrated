# athlete-keep-hydrated: Ideation Workshop

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore non-digital solutions to enhance athletes' hydration experience before and during a race. The ideation workshop was conducted to generate creative ideas and identify opportunities for innovation.

## Workshop Structure
### Participants
- Three external participants
- Facilitator: [Your Name]

### Materials Needed
- Sticky notes
- Markers
- A jar
- Timer
- Whiteboard or Miro/Figma board

### Ideation Constraints
Participants brainstormed solutions under different constraints:
1. If Pierre was blind
2. If Pierre was a bird
3. If Pierre was a billionaire
4. If Pierre had a twin who was constantly with him
5. If Pierre was 5 years old
6. If Pierre had 5 arms
7. If Pierre was 105 years old
8. If Pierre was very clumsy
9. If Pierre was very forgetful (and lost memory every 5 minutes)
10. If Pierre was deaf
11. If Pierre was a turtle
12. If Pierre was naked
13. If Pierre couldnâ€™t stop talking 24/7
14. If Pierre was always late
15. If Pierre was dishonest

### Process
1. **Introduction**
   - Context about Pierre (persona)
   - Explanation of the goal: "How might we help Pierre measure and prepare his hydration before a race?"
   
2. **Brainstorming (20 minutes)**
   - Each participant wrote ideas on sticky notes (one idea per note)
   - Ideas were read aloud and placed in a jar
   
3. **Voting (5 minutes)**
   - Each participant received 3 stickers to vote for the best ideas
   
4. **Synthesis**
   - Ideas were categorized based on feasibility and impact
   - A final solution was selected for further development

## Deliverables
- A Figma/Miro board containing all ideas
- Photos of the workshop session
- A zip file containing:
  - Workshop documentation
  - Selected idea and explanation
  - Any sketches or visual assets
  
## Conclusion
The ideation session provided valuable insights into potential hydration solutions for athletes. The next steps involve prototyping and testing the selected idea in real-world scenarios.
